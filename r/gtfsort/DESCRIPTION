Description: While current tools (most of them GFF3-focused) have been recommended for sorting GTF files, none are directed towards chr/pos/feature ordering. This approach ensures custom sorting directionality, which is useful for reducing computation times in tools that work with sorted GTF files. Furthermore, it provides a friendly and organized visualization of gene structures (gene -> transcript -> CDS/exon -> start/stop -> UTR/Sel), allowing users to search for features more efficiently.
